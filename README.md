# projects-that-I-made

Greetings! My name is Abby, and I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a budding data analyst. 
I've recently completed the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program on Coursera, where I've gained valuable skills in data analysis. 
Using these skills, I have completed a project that I'm proud of. 
My project involved various data analysis techniques to analyze and interpret complex datasets to derive insights and make informed decisions.
I would be happy to share my project with you and welcome any suggestions or feedback you may have.
